# Face and Eye Detection Project

This repository provides a simple implementation of face and eye detection using Haar Cascade classifiers with Python and OpenCV. The project demonstrates real-time detection of faces and eyes via webcam or processing of static images.

## Features
- Detect faces in images or video streams.
- Detect eyes within detected faces.
- Real-time video processing with OpenCV.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- OpenCV library
